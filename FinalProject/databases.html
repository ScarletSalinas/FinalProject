                <h1> Databases </h1>
                <p> 
                    The term database refers to a collection of data that is multidimensional in the
                    sense that internal links between its entries make the information accessible
                    from a variety of perspectives.
                </p> 
                <p>
                    Database systems have become the underlying technology that
                    supports many of the more popular sites on the World Wide Web. The underlying
                    theme of sites such as Google, eBay, and Amazon is to provide an interface between 
                    clients and databases. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    To respond to a client’s request, the server
                    interrogates a database, organizes the results in the form of a Web page, and
                    sends that page to the client. Such Web interfaces have popularized a new role
                    for database technology in which a database is no longer a means of storing a
                    company’s records but, instead, is the company’s product.
